Welcome to the Retax CRM System Website! This project is a React-based website inspired by the design and layout of the Retax CRM System on Behance. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing customer relationships and interactions.

## Skills and Learning

During this project, I gained hands-on experience in front-end development using ReactJS, Redux, and Chakra UI. I learned how to manipulate and handle data on the website using a JSON server.

## Design Inspiration
